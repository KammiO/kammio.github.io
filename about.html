<h2>About</h2>
<p>
Founded in 1993, Books n' Beans had its humble beginnings as a resale store for outdated college textbooks. As its cult status in the community grew, so did customer demand for a reliable source of caffeine. Thus, the current iteration of Books n' Beans was born.
</p>
<p>
We're open 7 days a week, offering impeccable coffee, fine pastries, and the most esoteric of publications.
</p>
<p>
Stop in for a hot beverageâ€”stick around for lost French translations of Howard Zinn!
</p>
<p>
Sincerely,
Your Friends at Books n' Beans
